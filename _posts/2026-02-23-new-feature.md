**New Feature Coming Soon**

---
Welcome to this weeks post! This week I'll be diving into a new feature that I've been contemplating adding to the blog, a comment section. To allow reader's to contribute to the conversation I will be adding a comment section to the bottom of every post to allow a reader to leave comments or thoughts about anything that I've talked about. This blog's main purpose is to be a source of community for new developers as well as veterans. Although my posts have been limited to one per week, my goal is to increase that number to at least four days.

On a side note, something interesting that I learned this week in my intro to programming course was Python's ability to break a single line statement into multiple lines. For the sake of readability, this makes it very convenient when working with multiple logical expressions that may cause a long single line of code to become difficult to read.

Thanks for reading and look out for new features coming soon!
