**Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read my post. This will focus on a project still under development called "Lair_of_xaldern" and the reason behind building it.**

During the winter break, I wanted to be proactive in preparing for my *Intro to Programming* course at Pikes Peak so I began to do some research. At the time, I did not know which route I needed to take or where to even begin, after some searching I came across Dr. Chuck's website, PY4E.com, which helped me through some of the basics as well as some of the "not so basic" topics like loops and the ever-frustrating *Regex* computer-language.
  
I struggled a lot in the beginning (roughly ch. 3 or 4 from PY4E.com) to understand loops and the concepts behind them, so I wanted a project that I could begin to practice with and test the skills I learned.

After a few weeks, and thoroughly working through PY4E and Pycharm's Programming course, I began working on *Lair_of_xaldern*. Although it is far from complete, it allowed me to start becoming familiar with lists, dictionaries, Objects, and databases. 

Currently, I am working on object-orientation to create hostile enemies for a player as well as creating a turn-based combat system. A long-term goal that I have for lair_of_xaldern is to turn it from a simple RPG using the command line into a full-fledged 2D RPG, but for now, the focus is laying the foundation before any narrative or content design.

Thanks for sticking through to the end, and I hope you enjoyed the read! If you liked what you read or want to know more, check out the links below and reach out!
