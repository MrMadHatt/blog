# About me

## The Balancing Act
Hi! I’m MrMadHatt. My life is a constant juggle between the world of syntax and the world of parenting. As a full-time Computer Science student at Pikes Peak State College and a full-time parent to three, my days are fueled by logic, curiosity, and probably a lot of coffee.

## My Tech Journey
I’ve always been drawn to the visual creativity of Web Design and the immersive logic of Game Development. However, lately, I’ve been pulled "under the hood" into Back-End Development. I love the challenge of building the invisible systems that make everything else work.

## Why This Blog?
Relocating to a new state and managing a packed schedule makes it tough to find a "coding circle" in person. I started this blog to:

- Connect: Reach out to fellow developers, students, and parents navigating similar paths.

- Document: Track my evolution from student to professional developer.

- Share: Break down the bugs that stumped me and the "aha!" moments that saved me.

##### My goal is simple: by sharing my journey, I hope to make the path a little smoother for the next person coding during nap time or between classes.
